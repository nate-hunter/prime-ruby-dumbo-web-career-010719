# You'll be defining a method, prime?(), that takes in an integer argument and returns a boolean of whether or not that integer is a prime number.

# A few things to think about:
  #  1. What defines an integer as a prime number? Research algorithms for how to determine if a number is prime.
  #  2. How do you create a range of numbers? How do you turn a range into an array so that it can be iterated over?

# A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number {\displaystyle n} n, called trial division, tests whether {\displaystyle n} n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and {\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}} {\sqrt {n}}. 

# Add  code here!

def prim?(int)
  if int %
    puts TRUE
  else
    FALSE
  end
